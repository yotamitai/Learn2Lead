          <p>TITLE OF RESEARCH: Investigating Human Policies in Ad-Hoc Teamwork <br><br>

            PURPOSE OF RESEARCH: To examine problem solving performance. <br><br>

            WHAT YOU WILL DO: You will be asked to play a simple board game. <br><br>

            TIME REQUIRED: Participation will take approximately 10 minutes. <br><br>

            RISKS: There are no anticipated risks associated with participating in this study. 
            The effects of participating should be comparable to those you would experience from 
            viewing a computer monitor for 10 minutes and using a mouse. <br><br>

            COMPENSATION: Upon completion of this task, you will receive a code to enter on the 
            Amazon Mechanical Turk task page, and you will receive the amount that was indicated 
            on the task page. <br><br>

            CONFIDENTIALITY: Your participation in this study will remain confidential. Your 
            responses will be assigned a code number. You will NOT be asked to provide your name 
            or any personal information. Throughout the experiment, we may collect data such as 
            browser type, operating system version, mouse movements, and error rates. The records 
            of this study will be kept private. Any work performed on MTurk can be linked to the 
            user’s public profile page. Thus, workers may wish to restrict what information they 
            choose to share in their public profile. Consider referencing Amazon.com’s warning to 
            workers: https://www.mturk.com/mturk/contact. Your MTurk worker IDs (i.e., the 14 
            character sequence of letters and numbers used to identify workers) will NOT be shared 
            with anyone.  MTurk worker IDs will only be collected for the purposes of distributing 
            compensation and will not be associated with their responses. In any sort of report we 
            make public we will not include any information that will make it possible to identify 
            you without your explicit consent. Research records will be kept in a locked file; only 
            the researchers will have access to the records. <br><br>

            PARTICIPATION AND WITHDRAWAL: Your participation in this study is voluntarily, and you 
            may withdraw and return the task to Amazon Mechanical Turk at any time. You will receive 
            compensation only if you complete the task. You may withdraw at any time by closing the 
            web page of the task. <br><br>

            CONTACT: This study is conducted by researchers at the University of Texas at Austin. 
            If you have any questions or concerns about this study, please contact reuth@cs.utexas.edu. <br><br>

            CONSENT: I have read the above information and the nature and purpose of this research 
            have been sufficiently explained. I consent to take part in the study. I understand that 
            I am free to withdraw at any time. <br><br>
            
            I agree and will participate in this study. <br><br>
